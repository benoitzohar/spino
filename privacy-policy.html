                <p>Spino values your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information of the users of the
                    website <a href="/">https://spino.tapadi.uno</a> and the associated phone application (together
                    the
                    "<strong>Website</strong>") and the associated services (the "<strong>Services</strong>"). In this
                    Privacy Policy, "Spino", "we", "us" or "our" means Spino.</p>
                <p>To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy which explains how we collect, use,
                    share and store your personal information, and how this personal information can be accessed and
                    corrected when necessary.</p>
                <p>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using the Website and/or Services. By visiting or
                    accessing the Website, using our Services, contacting us or agreeing to receive emails from Spino,
                    you accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If, at any time, you do not or
                    cannot agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, you must stop visiting or accessing the Website,
                    using our Services and contacting us.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not extend to websites operated by third parties. Spino is therefore not
                    liable for their privacy policies, procedures and practices. As used in this policy, the terms
                    "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information
                    to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not
                    limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and
                    transferring information within our organization.</p>

                <h3 id="1-what-information-do-we-collect">1. What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
                <p>The types of personal and other information we may collect about you are primarily from two sources:
                    (a) information automatically collected; and (b) cookies. The processing is carried out in our
                    legitimate interests, which are further explained in the “How Do We Use Your Information” section.
                    We <strong>do not</strong> collect other personal informations such as name, email, phone number.
                </p>
                <h4 id="a-information-automatically-collected">a) Information Automatically Collected</h4>
                <p>Spino automatically collects session information about your computer when you visit the Website. For
                    example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome or
                    Internet Explorer), and referring website.</p>
                <p>When you visit the Website, we automatically send to <strong>Google Analytics</strong>,
                    <strong>Amplitude</strong>, and <strong>Sentry</strong> informations that your browser sends
                    whenever you visit a website or use an application ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may
                    include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address,
                    browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website
                    that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access
                    times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
                <p>We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website , to increase our Website’s
                    functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Website to our visitors’ needs. We
                    also use this information to verify that visitors to the Website meet the criteria required to
                    process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as personal information or use it in association
                    with other personal information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for
                    the same purposes as stated above regarding other non-identifying information.</p>
                <h4 id="b-cookies">b) Cookies</h4>
                <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we
                    transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes.
                    First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the
                    Website. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better
                    understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by Spino users and web
                    traffic routing on the Website. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your
                    computer when you log off from the Website and then close your browser.</p>
                <h3 id="2-how-do-we-use-your-information">2. How Do We Use Your Information?</h3>
                <p>We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Services and operating
                    our business, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to enhance and provide all features of the Services, to provide the services and information
                        that you request, to respond to comments and questions and to provide support to users of the
                        Services;</li>
                    <li>to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the
                        Services, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality;</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="3-what-information-do-we-share-andor-disclose">3. What Information Do We Share And/Or Disclose?
                </h3>
                <p>Internally, only employees who need access to your information for the execution of their duties will
                    have access to it. Spino may also share your personal information with third-party service
                    providers working on behalf of Spino and with law enforcement authorities.</p>
                <p>In the event of a change of ownership, sale, merger, liquidation, reorganization or acquisition of
                    Spino, in whole or in part, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction, as long
                    as, the party acquiring such information agrees to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h3 id="4-how-do-we-store-your-information">4. How Do We Store Your Information?</h3>
                <p>Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in
                    which we engage third party service providers. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of
                    information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection
                    rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws
                    of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or
                    law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country.
                    However, our practices regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed
                    by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the <em>General Data Protection
                        Regulation</em> ("GDPR") requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal
                    information from the EU/EEA to third country.</p>
                <p>While we maintain a multitude of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of
                    your personal information, no security measures are absolute or wholly guaranteed. We will make
                    reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine there were unauthorized acts by third parties that
                    violate the law or this policy, or other security breaches, or where otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>When you connect to <strong>Google Calendar</strong> using our Oauth Application, we store your
                    access token to your personal Calendar for a short amount of time. All of your <strong>Google
                        Calendar</strong> access data is deleted from our database as soon as the connection information
                    is retrieve by our Service. The Service needs the access data to display your events on your TV.
                    This data will only be available on your instance of the Service, on your AppleTV and will be
                    removed if you choose to disconnect from Google Calendar or remove the application from your Apple
                    TV.</p>

                    required by law.</p>
